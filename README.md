# blender_python_scripts

This is a list of Blender Python scripts that I use or made:


Zoy's basic scripts, made with ChatGPT

- render_viewport.py --- whatever appears in your 3d viewport is rendered

- create_empty_as_constraint_for_objects.py --- creates empty for a set of selected objects; use the empty to control location, rotation of group

- reset_bones_and_armatures.py --- sets selected rigs back to default pose and to world origin

- save_render_as_filename_frame_seq.py --- saves render of active camera as blendname_frame_00x.png in specified directory


Other people's scripts

- export_multiple_objects_from_blender_as_obj_or_fbx.py --- export selected objects into their own individual obj files
